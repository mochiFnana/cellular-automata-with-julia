Julia Cellular Automaton
This is a 2D cellular automaton simulation developed in the Julia programming language. The program generates and evolves a grid of cells based on a set of custom rules.

Key Features
Innovative Rule System: Utilizes a clever method of mapping 3x3 neighborhood patterns to unique complex numbers, allowing for an elegant and efficient rule lookup.

High Performance: Built in Julia to leverage its speed for numerical simulations, ensuring a fluid and responsive experience.

Simple and Extensible: The rules are easily modified in a single array, allowing for quick experimentation with different behaviors.
